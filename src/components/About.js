            <p className = "text-4xl">My name is Grace Nieboer. I am a full stack software engineer with a love for the creative elements of front-end design, but lately I have also fallen in love with Python on the back end along with restful API architecture.</p>

            <p className="text-3xl">BACKGROUND</p>
            <p className="text-2xl">I have a Master's degree in Public Administration, with a professional background in Human Resources. I've spent the past few years of my career working in employee relations roles within HR, partnering with multi-lingual, cross-functional teams to work through employee issues and resolve conflicts. 
             </p>

             <p className="text-3xl">PERSON-FOCUSED</p>
             <p className="text-xxl">My unique background in complex problem solving in a very person-focused industry and roles allows me better collaborate and communicate with diverse teams. We work in tech, but we work with humans, to help other humans.</p>
